<h1>The Best Movies According to Mark</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>The matrix is a sci-fi movie with cool visual effects and storyline. It is about living in a virtual reality in which
    people thought is the real world. </p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>The movie is based on a real life tragedy that shocked the world. The Titanic was a the biggest ship of its time and
    once thought as unsinkable. However, during it's first voyage, the ship was damaged severely as it hit an iceberg
    causing it to sink. </p>

<h3>Karate Kid</h3>
<p>One of the greatest movie is the Karate Kid. It's greatness does not come from the visual effects but rather from the
    values it presents to the audience. </p>
